==> create a new user and new group for CDH distribution:
    - sudo groupadd cloudera
    - sudo useradd -g cloudera -m cloudera
    - sudo passwd cloudera

==> make sure jdk version is up to date on your severs:
    - do "javac -version" to check the jdk version
    - CDH 5 requires jdk 1.7.0_55 or later

(Optional) ==> Install appropriate jdk version (using jdk 8 as an example)
    - go to the Oracle site, agree with their "license agreement"
        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
    - right click the jdk distribution link that you are looking for, select "Copy link address"
    - go back to your terminal, use wget. In my case, it's:
        wget http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u51-b16/jdk-8u51-linux-x64.tar.gz
    - tar xzf jdk-8u45-linux-i586.tar.gz
    - move jdk to a sys directory: "mv jdk.../ /opt/"
    - cd /opt/jdk1.8.0_45/
    - use "alternatives" command to install, as there could be multiple java already installed on your box:
        alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/java 2
    - pick the java version that you want to use on a regular basis:
        alternatives --config java
    - user "alternatives" to set the sys commands such as javac, jar and etc.:
        alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /opt/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/jar 2
	alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/javac 2
	alternatives --set jar /opt/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/jar
        alternatives --set javac /opt/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/javac 
    - set java environment variables:
        export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_45
        export JRE_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_45/jre
        export PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk1.8.0_45/bin:/opt/jdk1.8.0_45/jre/bin
        
==> the user who run cloudera-manager-installer MUST BE sudoer:
    http://askubuntu.com/questions/7477/how-can-i-add-a-new-user-as-sudoer-using-the-command-line

==> SELinux must be disabled in order to run cloudera-manager-installer.
    http://www.crypt.gen.nz/selinux/disable_selinux.html
    
==> if not using single user mode (recommended), the user must be able to do "sudo" without password, edit "/etc/hosts" and add:
    %YOURUSERNAME%         ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    - this user must be able to do the same thing on ALL nodes within the cluster
